Done:
- Implicit (level 1) and Explicit (a small subset only) modes (SM / RM 8).
- Overall LTR or RTL direction (SPD 0 / 3).
- Possibility to autodetect paragraph direction (DECSET / DECRST 2501).
- Possibility to make box drawing characters mirrorable (DECSET / DECRST 2500).
- I-Beam cursor shows the character's resolved directionality when the
  paragraph has a foreign directionality character.
- Mouse highlighting, text copying (logical in normal modes, visual in
  rectangle mode).
- Mouse reporting.
- Regex match and explicit hyperlink underlining on hover.
- VTE_DEBUG=bidi highlights characters with resolved RTL directionality.
- Test file.
- Configure flag.

Bugs:
- Upon a reset, the directionality of cells isn't properly restored.
- The way the modes apply to paragraphs, and what happens when a paragraph
  is split or two paragraphs are joined is just a first hack, needs to be
  reviewed, adjusted, fixed properly.

Missing from first release:
- The entire screen is always invalidated. Have some more fine grained
  solution (see also vte #26).
- Probably we'd need to make Erase in Display (Below or All) sequences turn
  the previous line to hard wrapped, requiring to keep one more line in the
  ring's writable area.
- Design doc review & publishing, public tracking issue.
- Brief summary about the design and implemented features in the source tree.
- Code cleanup and review, of course.

Planned future improvements:
- Shaping.
- Right-align RTL glyphs.
- Implicit mode level 2 (handling BiDi control characters).
- Mirror the glyphs that don't have mirrored counterpart.
- Play with other possibilities for placing the cursor (especially when it's
  at the end of the logical line).
- Play with better placement of the preedit box.
- Keyboard arrow swapping.
- Remember some lines that are no longer user-accessible as they scroll out,
  to properly BiDi the still remaining part of that paragraph.
- Possibility for default RTL directionality?
- API (for what exactly)?

Not planned at all:
- Operating on the presentation component (DCSM reset).
- BiDi in explicit mode by transferring the embedding levels (SDS, SRS...).
- Escape sequences that modify the emulation behavior (SIMD...).
- Other silly escape sequences (SCP...).

Useful aliases:
  alias ltr='echo -ne "\e[0 S"'
  alias rtl='echo -ne "\e[3 S"'
  alias implicit='echo -ne "\e[8h"'
  alias explicit='echo -ne "\e[8l"'
  alias bidi='echo -ne "\e[8h"'    # same as implicit
  alias nobidi='echo -ne "\e[8l"'  # same as explicit
  alias box-mirror='echo -ne "\e[?2500h"'
  alias box-normal='echo -ne "\e[?2500l"'
  alias auto='echo -ne "\e[?2501h"'
  alias noauto='echo -ne "\e[?2501l"'
